Finlit is a minimal Streamlit app that creates dashboards to keep track of your
personal finances and investments.

It uses pandas and duckdb to query data from a Beancount ledger file, and mainly
Altair to create the visualizations.

I had a rough system using postgreSQL and Grafana, which you can still see in
the repo, but it will be deleted soon.
